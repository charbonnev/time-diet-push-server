## Integration with Time Diet PWA

This server is designed to work with the Time Diet PWA frontend. The frontend uses the `PushNotificationManager` utility to:

1. Subscribe users to push notifications
2. Send scheduled notifications for time blocks
3. Handle notification clicks and actions

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` | VAPID public key for push authentication | Yes |
| `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` | VAPID private key for push authentication | Yes |
| `VAPID_EMAIL` | Contact email (mailto: format) | Yes |
| `PORT` | Server port (default: 3001) | No |

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- VAPID keys should be kept secure and not exposed to clients (except public key)
- In production, use a proper database instead of in-memory storage
- Consider rate limiting for production deployments

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:

1. **Database**: Replace in-memory subscription storage with Redis/PostgreSQL
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting middleware
3. **HTTPS**: Ensure server runs on HTTPS
4. **Environment**: Use proper environment variable management
5. **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring
6. **Scaling**: Consider horizontal scaling for high traffic
